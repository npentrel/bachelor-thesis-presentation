Even though an evaluation is not fully possible given the limited time frame, we will attempt to evaluate the created system and presentations as well as their shortcomings. 


Systematically, the knowledge presentation system RPresentation that was developed allows for the creation of a clearly structured relational presentation from a given annotated document which fulfills the goal of this project.

When using Prezi, human beings can creatively think of links and therefore make more graphical presentations. Due to the fact that our system only has limited intelligence, we end up with a far more structured presentation. However, considering that the goal of the created presentation, it became obvious that a simple structure for this presentation is actually preferable.\\

Cognitively, we explored a part of the field of information systems. It is still an open question whether the developed system provides a better system for knowledge transfer. I strongly believe that the created system RPresentation adds value to presentation and has the power to facilitate and improve knowledge transfer.\\

In the Related Works, there some argued that the linking of learning materials is useful for knowledge transfer and that especially mathematics is a field that could profit from guided tours through topics as a way of learning topics according to users' individual knowledge bases.\\

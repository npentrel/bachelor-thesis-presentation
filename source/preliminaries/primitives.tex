Five evaluation criteria for knowledge representation are known [Koh14]: Expressive Adequacy, Reasoning Efficiency, Primitives, Meta-representation, and Incompleteness. 

\begin{definition}
  \defi{Primitives} are the different elements of representation that can be divided into structural and semantic primitives.
\end{definition}

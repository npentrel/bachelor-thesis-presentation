\noindent
The concept of Spatial Narrative stems from the establishment of frameworks for "the creation of computer-assisted flexible \textit{guided tours} based on the thematically and narrative linking of a set of locations within an area into a \textit{spatial narrative}" [Pre14].\\

\noindent
The benefit of spatial narrative is that the audience gains a more thorough understanding of the subject and has a better understanding of the interconnections between different pieces of information. \\

When doing a good prezi presentation one has to understand the topic one is presenting on a deeper level and think about how one can portray connections between content visually.\\

The concept of Spatial Narrative stems from the establishment of frameworks for "the creation of computer-assisted flexible \textit{guided tours} based on the thematically and narrative linking of a set of locations within an area into a \textit{spatial narrative}" [Pre14].

The benefit of spatial narrative is that the audience gains a more thorough understanding of the subject and has a better understanding of the interconnections between different pieces of information. 

In this research we will use this knowledge to form an interconnected network of information that tells a visual story based on semantic closeness to facilitate the transfer of knowledge.\\
